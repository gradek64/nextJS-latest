# Menu and App Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Header Component Props Issue

- **Problem**: The `Header` component wasn't accepting props that the `Shell` component was passing to it
- **Solution**: Added proper TypeScript interface `HeaderProps` with optional props for `bundle`, `html`, `stylesheet`, and `brand`
- **Result**: Eliminated TypeScript compilation errors

### 2. Responsive Menu Functionality

- **Problem**: Mobile menu CSS wasn't working properly - media queries weren't applied correctly
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper responsive CSS using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with media queries
  - Improved mobile menu with smooth slide-down animation
  - Added hover effects for better user experience
  - Made desktop navigation hide on mobile and vice versa

### 3. Empty Page Content

- **Problem**: About and Attractions pages were empty
- **Solution**:
  - Created meaningful content for both pages using the design system components
  - Added responsive grid layouts and informative content
  - Used proper Tailwind CSS classes with the design system prefix

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- **Improvements Made**:
  - Added smooth transitions and hover effects for navigation links
  - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels
  - Added animation for mobile menu dropdown
  - Enhanced visual feedback for interactive elements
